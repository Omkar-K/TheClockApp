I have developed a simple application which displays the current time extracted from the phone. 
It also has some functionalities in which you can change color and themes of clock.Also has a timer accessible from main screen.

*Some functionalities:*

- The setting screen has options like changing color of hand and changing theme from Dark to Light.
- Once saved you jump to the clock screen and can see the result.
- The setting info is passed to the Clock by SharedPreferences method.
- The Clock is drawn using View.
- A CustomView is defined in the MainLayout
- View is extended in the class the clock is made.
- Various math functions are used for the animation.
- Paint method is used for the colors.
